Publisher Settings
==================

Publisher is built to work with any News API feed and thus it can be used as a frontend solution for, say, Wordpress-created content, a custom CMS solution, or just a feed that you subscribe to with any provider.

But if you use Publisher along with Superdesk, then you have a **Web Site Management** GUI that integrates seamlessly into the Superdesk environment. From there, you can manage one or many websites (or, more generally, output channels) with as many tenants as you want.
